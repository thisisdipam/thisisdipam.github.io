This <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8722433">paper</a> presents a novel architecture titled "Recurrent Capsule Network" for text classification. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is evaluated on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge">"Toxic Comment Classification Challenge Dataset, Kaggle"</a> provided by Jigsaw. We have also evaluated the performance of proposed recurrent capsule networks on other text classification benchmarks such as AG News, IMDB Large Movie Review and Yelp Reviews - Polarity and Full.

## Thank You!
