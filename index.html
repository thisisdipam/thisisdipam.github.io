        <p class="bio">Hello! I am a graduate student at <a href="https://ethz.ch/de.html">ETH Zürich</a>, pursuing MSc. in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology. My research interests broadly lie in the field of Machine Learning and Optimization.</p>
        <p class="bio">I have completed a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from <a href="https://www.vjti.ac.in/">Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI)</a>, Mumbai. Ever since my undergraduate days, I've been obsessed with creating ML models for analyzing data, and developing solutions to complex research problems in various domains. In the past, I have worked with Prof. Dr. Faruk Kazi, investigating the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate fake videos, and subsequently look for ways to detect them. I also worked as a Research Assistant at CoE-CNDS Lab, VJTI on various funded research projects in the areas of Machine learning and Cyber Security.</p>
