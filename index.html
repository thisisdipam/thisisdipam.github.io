        <p class="bio"> My name is Dipam Paul and I am a final year undergraduate from KIIT University, India (LinkedIn) pursuing Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering and bearing a current CGPA of 9.11/10. I am currently working at Xu Lab @ Carnegie Mellon University working on areas of Object Detection of macromolecules concerning 3D Cryo-ET Data and Deep Active Learning with a special focus on solving the Catastrophic Interference problem in Dynamically Expandable Networks.
 
I have also worked at Banerjee Lab @ Emory University as a Research Assistant and we worked on a problem to solve the problems associated with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for patients with Parkinson's disease and got our work on Super Learner published (short paper) at Trustworthy AI for Healthcare workshop @ AAAI'21 under the supervision of Dr. Imon Banerjee.

Before this, I worked as a Research Intern till 14th August 2020 at Dr. Eva Dyer's lab (NerDS) at Georgia Tech. I worked on a Triplet Loss ranking problem to embed Brain Imagery while also creating a ranking dataset for the same. 

Previously, I have also worked at Dr. Amit Sethi's MeDAL Lab at IIT Bombay which encompasses and works on areas of Biomedical Imaging and Analysis. We are currently working on modeling and training an Auxiliary Classifier GAN to optimize the latent vector variables and hence improve on a model to detect COVID-19 from Chest X-Ray Images (CoronaNET), while also working to integrate a semi-supervised approach into the same using SimCLR to counteract the lack of availability of data.

Research Interests: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, Representation Learning.
